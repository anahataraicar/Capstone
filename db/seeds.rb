# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


# Pet.create(name:"Sanchez", age:2, species:"guinea pig", owner_id:1, pet_id:3,bio:"Loves to eat carrots and apples", gender:"M",image:"http://www.petmd.com/sites/default/files/diarrhea-guinea-pigs.jpg" )
